## React Accessibility Best Practices

- Add text alternative to all of your images
- Add a text alternative to your video and audio
- Add a name to all of your controls
- Write text transcripts for any audio-only media
- Write text transcripts for any video-only media
- Record an audio-track for any video-only media
- Place the text transcript, or link to it, close to the media
- Add captions to all videos with sound
- Provide a full text transcript of the video
- Provide a version of the video with audio description
- Break up content with subheadings for new sections
- Mark those headings with HTML header tags
- Use the correct HTML for all structural elements
- Use valid HTML everywhere else
- Use clear labels on forms
- Present content in a meaningful order.
- Separate navigation menus from content.
- Use paragraphs in order.
- Use headings to show importance.
- Choose whether a list needs numbering or not.
- Use valid HTML and check it with the W3C’s markup validator.
- Use more than one sense for instructions.
- Avoid instructions that rely on sound.
- Instructions must not rely on color alone.
- Other information (like charts and graphs) must not rely on color alone.
- Don’t have any audio that plays automatically.
- Have all the audio you want, just let your users choose when they want to hear it.
- A clean HTML and CSS website will often have keyboard accessibility without further work
- Unplug your mouse and make sure you can fully use your website with your keyboard
- Make sure no function on your website requires timed keystrokes – such as double tap enter/return within two seconds to submit
- Test your website to make sure you can navigate away from, as well as to, all parts of your website by keyboard only.
- Make sure all navigation is controllable by either the ‘Tab’ or arrow keys, which is a standard many people are familiar with.
- If your website uses a time limit:
  * Give your users an option to turn off the time limit before it begins (for example, a landing page before the time-controlled page can display a message that shows your customers what to do); or
  * Give your users the option to adjust the time limit before it begins, over a range of at least ten times the default setting (you can do this with a landing page too); or
  * Give your users the option to extend the period at least twenty seconds before it expires. This must be a simple action like clicking a button and must be available to use at least ten times.
- If your website has moving or animated text, users must be able to pause the movement.
- If your website has a feature that updates automatically (for example, with the latest football scores), you must allow your users to delay the frequency of the updates by at least ten times the default setting.
- Moving, blinking or scrolling content must have an option to pause, stop or hide it; and
- Auto-updating content must have the same options; or
- An option to control frequency
- Don’t add anything to your website that flashes more than three times per second.
- Add a ‘Skip to Content’ link to all pages on your website. It’s best if you make the link visible.
- Give each page on your website a unique and descriptive title.
  * A useful format for writing page titles is: `Page name – Page description – Website name`
- A well-made HTML website will often comply with this guideline.
- Unplug your mouse and verify that you can use the ‘Tab’ key to navigate to every part of your website and use every function, including search boxes and forms – make sure each page has a sensible focus order.
- The purpose of the link is clear from the link text (for example, ‘My blog’); or
- The purpose of the link is clear from the surrounding content, meaning the same sentence, paragraph or cell in a table (for example, ‘Visit my blog’ ); or
- If the link is an image, the alt text of the image makes the link purpose clear (for example, ‘Luke McGrath – Visit my blog’); and
- Links with the same destination have the same description (but links don’t share a description if they point to different places)
- Ensure that each page of your website has a language assigned to it.
- Ensure no element changes purely by receiving focus.
- Avoid both behavioral and visual modifications.
- Links don’t open automatically on focus; and
- Forms don’t submit without the user taking action (such as clicking the ‘Submit’ button); and
- There are no automatic pop-ups; and
- Focus never jumps to another element automatically; and
- No other action that occurs on focus alone causes the page to change.
- Forms must not auto-submit when all fields are filled – this prevents your users from checking and editing what they have written.
- Focus (the field where the user will input next) must not automatically jump to the next field in a form once a field is complete.
- Using a control (like selecting yes or no) must not automatically perform the action (for example, selecting to subscribe to a newsletter in a check box must not automatically subscribe your user, they should be able to click a submit button to confirm their decision).
- Identify and explain to the user any mistakes that you can detect automatically.
- Add error explanation close to the error, showing what is wrong and how to fix it.
- If a form requires input in a certain format, show and describe the required format.
- If a mandatory field is empty, highlight the field and explain what’s required.
- Build forms to be forgiving, accepting variations on the formats you prefer.
- Don’t ask for too much information, just what you need.
- Be specific. Use clear, concise instruction and form field labels.
- Highlight mistakes in forms with colors and symbols.
- Don’t clear a form if a user makes a mistake. Save the information and allow the user to edit their error and continue.
- Provide extra help by giving your contact details on all pages (the header or footer are great) and especially near forms.
- Label all input fields clearly and helpfully.
- Where a field needs a specific format, give an example (For example, for a ‘date’ field in a form you might use ‘Enter the date as dd/mm/yyyy’)
- Mark required fields with an icon and explain what the icon means before the form.
- Keep your labels simple – too much explanation can be counter-productive. Things like ‘First name’, ‘Email’ and ‘Your message’ are fine.
- The same goes for instructions, ‘Required fields are in red and have a * symbol’ works great. So does ‘Fill in this form and click ‘Submit’ to get in touch’.
- Ensure HTML elements have complete start ( < > ) and end ( </ > ) tags where needed.
- Nest all HTML elements correctly (for example, list objects within an ordered or unordered list).
- Use unique Ids.
- Check that HTML elements don’t contain duplicate attributes.
- Use HTML specifications for any script you author for your website.
- If you use a plugin or other element authored by a third party, make sure it uses valid HTML markup.
- A good – though not foolproof – way to test your website is a HTML validator tool. A validator gives you an idea of how well technology can parse your website. Use it to create a list of priorities.
- The majority of your potential issues will come from third-party code.
- Speak to the developers of any plugins you use and make sure that they’re writing good code.
- Make sure that everything on your website parses correctly.
- Pay close attention to things like names and labels.
- Use a content management system that allows captions to be added live and probably a professional subtitler to do it for you.
- Make an alternative version of your video with an audio description soundtrack and link to it from near the original content
- Make sure the contrast ratio between your text and background is at least 4.5
- Using a light background and dark text
- Using a dark background and light text
- Using WebAim’s color contrast checker to verify your choice
- Remember to ensure that all colors used conform. This includes links that change color after being used once, and headings in menus and sidebars, as well as main content.
- Make sure that any embedded charts or images of charts have the minimum contrast between elements
- Resizing text is different to zooming (which enlarges text, images and layout without preserving formatting).
- Check your website by resizing to 200% in a variety of browsers.
- Make sure your resized text doesn’t require the user to scroll horizontally
- Do not use an image of text when you can use plain text.
- Display quotes as text rather than images.
- Use CSS to style headings.
- Use CSS to style navigation menus as text.
- Adding an HTML site-map page
- Including a search function on every page
- Providing a clear and consistent main navigation menu.
- Use informative headings and subheadings where appropriate (a change in topic or purpose) to aid navigation through your content.
- Label all elements (for example, sidebar widgets, forms, search boxes, tables).
- Make the keyboard focus visible on all elements
- Use CSS to apply a visual aid to keyboard focus – a border and/or underline is best.
- Set your website’s main language by meta tag
- Add a language attribute to content that is not in the main language.
- HTML language codes match the ISO language codes standard.
- If you have an alternative language version or translation of some content, link to it with the name of the language in that language (for example, ‘Francis’, ‘Deutsch’) and add a language tag to the link.
- Keep navigation menus in the same location on all pages
- Present the options in navigation menus in the same order on all pages
- Keep all other standard elements (for example, your search box) in the same location on all pages
- Any icons used are consistent (for example, ‘Print page’ or Twitter link); and
- Elements with the same function are labeled and named consistently; or
- Elements with the same function have a consistent text alternative.
- Your forms identify input errors.
- When the error is missing a required field, communicate this to the user with a text suggestion.
- If the error is in the format of the input, the suggestion shows the correct format
- If the error is because the input needed to be from a limited list of values, provide these values and explain them.
- Add a confirmation page to the data input submission process that summarises the input and the outcome, with an option to correct or discontinue. This page has an input field
- Legal commitments, financial transactions, test responses and changes to user controlled data are checked for input errors and the user is given a chance to correct any mistakes
- Legal commitments, financial transactions, test responses and changes to user controlled data are reversible
- Make an alternative version of your video with a sign language interpreter embedded and link to it from near the original content.
- Make an alternative version of your video with an extended audio description soundtrack and link to it from near the original content.
- Provide a full text transcript for your video and link to it from near the original content.
- If the video needs audio description, make sure that is also in place.
- Add closed captions to live audio
- If the live broadcast is from a prepared script, make the script text available from near the original content
- Make sure your pre-recorded audio does not contain any background noise
- If there has to be some background noise, it is generally 20 decibels lower than the foreground noise. That’s about four times quieter.
- Provide a tool that enables your customers to select from a number of background and foreground colors
- Text blocks must be no wider than 80 characters
- Text is not justified to both sides of the webpage
- Provide a tool that enables your users to select from a number of line and paragraph spacing options – one of the options must give line spacing that is at least 1.5 in text blocks and spaces between paragraphs are at least 1.5x line spacing
- Provide a tool that enables your users to select from a number of line and paragraph spacing options – one of the options must give line spacing that is at least 1.5 in text blocks and spaces between paragraphs are at least 1.5x line spacing
- Avoid using abbreviations, acronyms and initialisms.
- If you need to use an abbreviation, you can explain the meaning to your users by:
  * Showing the meaning in the text (for example, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)); or
  * Linking the abbreviation to a definition on a glossary page on your website; or
  * Linking the abbreviation to a definition footnote on the same page; or
  * Using the abbreviation HTML tag to expand the abbreviation.
- Writing so that someone with no more than nine years of school can understand you
- Adding summaries, images and diagrams to content to help explain meaning.
- Breaking up content with well-organized sections and headings.
- Avoid using words where the meaning, in context, is ambiguous without a pronunciation guide
- If you need to use such a word, you can explain the meaning to your users by:
  * Providing the phonetic pronunciation of words immediately after the word; or
  * Linking the word to a pronunciation guide on another page on your website; or
  * Linking the word to a pronunciation guide on the same page.
- If you have an element that updates automatically (like a live news ticker), there is an option to pause this and update only when requested
- All links open in the same window, unless it’s essential
- Forms do not auto-submit when fields are filled
- Any redirect from one page to another is immediate.
- All data input submissions are reversible
- All data input submissions are checked for input errors and the user is given a chance to correct any mistakes
- Add a confirmation page to the data input submission process that summarises the input and the outcome, with an option to correct or discontinue. This page has an input field (for example, a confirm button or checkbox) that acts as confirmation of the submission.
